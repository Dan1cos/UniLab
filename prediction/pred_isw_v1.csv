<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian milbloggers have provided enough geolocated footage and textual reports to confirm that Ukrainian forces have established positions in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast as of April 22 though not at what scale or with what intentions.</strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В Geolocated footage published by a Russian milblogger on April 22 shows that Ukrainian forces have established positions on the Dnipro River bank north of Oleshky (7km southwest of Kherson City) and advanced up to the northern outskirts of the settlement on the E97 highway, as well as west of Dachi (10km south of Kherson City).[1]В This footage also indicates that Russian forces may not control islands in the Kinka and Chaika rivers less than half a kilometer north of the geolocated Ukrainian positions near the Antonivsky Bridge. Russian milbloggers claimed on April 20 and 22 that Ukrainian forces have maintained positions in east bank Kherson Oblast for weeks, established stable supply lines to these positions, and regularly conduct sorties in the areaвЂ”all indicating a lack of Russian control over the area.[2]В Another milbloggerвЂ™s battle map claimed that Russian forces do not control some Dnipro River delta islands southwest of Kherson City as of April 22, suggesting possible Ukrainian advances on these islands.[3]В Some milbloggers complained that the slow rate of Russian artillery fire due to the over-centralization of the Russian military command allowed Ukrainian forces to land on the east bank.[4]В Russian forces may be prioritizing maintaining defenses in urban areas such as Oleshky and Nova Kakhovka, leaving the islands in the Dnipro River delta unmanned. The extent and intent of these Ukrainian positions remain unclear, as does UkraineвЂ™s ability and willingness to maintain sustained positions in this area. ISW is recoding territory on the east bank of the Dnipro River to Ukrainian-held only now because this is the first time ISW has observed reliable geolocated imagery of Ukrainian positions on the east bank along with multi-sourced Russian reports of an enduring Ukrainian presence there.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin is likely attempting to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to go over to the defensive ahead of a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive.В </strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Prigozhin argued on April 21 that Russia needs to вЂњanchor itself in such a way that it is only possible to tear out [Russian forces from their positions] with the claws of the opponent.вЂќ[5]В PrigozhinвЂ™s comment followed a discussion of the Ramstein meeting results, Western commitments to train more Ukrainian personnel and continuous military support for Ukraine. Prigozhin also noted that Ukraine will try to вЂњtearвЂќ Russian forces apart and that Russia needs to resist such attacks. Prigozhin has been increasingly alarmist in his recent rhetoric and has made similar statements about the uncertain future of Russian offensive operations in Donbas.[6]В PrigozhinвЂ™s calls for strengthening Russian defenses in occupied territories and frequent discussions of the prospects of Ukrainian counteroffensives are notable as they indicate that he is trying to amplify the discussion in the Russian domestic information space. Russia, however, continues to conduct offensive operations in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Prigozhin is also advocating for Russia to focus on holding the current frontlines rather than seeking more gains so that Russian forces can regain their combat effectiveness for later offensive operations.В </strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Prigozhin is not arguing for Russia to end the war and negotiate with Ukraine and the West as some Russian and Western sources reported, as ISW previously observed, but is instead condemning the faction within the Kremlin that is hoping to end the war in negotiations.[7]В Prigozhin is actually arguing that Russia needs to meet the upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive at full strength and try to hold the current frontlines without ending the war or entering into peace negotiations.[8]В He argues that a pause after the Ukrainian attack culminates would allow Russia to regain combat power and build nationalist support within the Russian society for renewing the fight even in the event of a defeat.[9]В Prigozhin is also attempting to redefine and undermine some of PutinвЂ™s key maximalist goals in UkraineвЂ”namely the вЂњdenazificationвЂќ and вЂњdemilitarizationвЂќ of UkraineвЂ”likely to minimize the informational impact that might result from going over to the defensive and abandoning efforts to gain more ground now.[10]В Russian far-right paramilitary formation Rusich (Sabotage Assault Reconnaissance Group), which facilitates recruitment of Russian ultranationalist and irregular forces, echoed PrigozhinвЂ™s rejection of the вЂњdenazificationвЂќ and вЂњdemilitarizationвЂќ goals.[11]В Rusich noted that Russia is fighting Ukraine to avenge Donbas, for living space, and for combat experienceвЂ”rather than fighting claimed Ukrainian вЂњfascismвЂќ and вЂњNazism.вЂќ By reframing PutinвЂ™s goals, Prigozhin and some factions within the ultranationalist community may be attempting to condition the Russian domestic information space for the prospect of frozen frontlines, potentially near the initial lines of February 23, 2022.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">The Russian military command is likely attempting to convince Putin to turn to defensive operations as wellвЂ”but may be unable to bluntly deliver this message to Putin.</strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В Some ultranationalist figures argued that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) signaled efforts to recruit 400,000 contract servicemen to ensure that Russia has enough military personnel to defend existing frontlines and to efficiently freeze the current frontlines in Ukraine.[12]В The Russian military command is also reportedly transferring conscripts to hold Russian lines in Crimea and may be planning to prepare other resources to ensure that Russia can retain some lines once the potential Ukrainian counteroffensive culminates.[13]В Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the Russian General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov are likely sensible to the threat of the Ukrainian counteroffensive but are likely continuing to send contract servicemen to reinforce senseless offensive operations at PutinвЂ™s insistence.[14]В Kremlin sources previously revealed that Putin favors loyalty over competence, and this sentiment likely prevents Shoigu and Gerasimov from focusing on setting optimal conditions for an efficient defense by refusing to expend Russian elite units in grinding attritional battles for marginal gains.[15]В ISW previously observed that Shoigu and Gerasimov were likely unable to convince Putin to conduct mobilization in May 2022вЂ”despite the fact that Russia needed such a measure to reconstitute forces necessary to maintain offensive operations in Ukraine.[16]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">The Russian military command may have partially repaired its strained relationship with Prigozhin to persuade Putin to halt offensive operations via the Russian information space.В </strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">ISW has observed a sudden improvement in PrigozhinвЂ™s relations with the Russian MoD and the Kremlin since early April. The Russian MoD, for example, began to directly acknowledge Wagner forces in its daily situational reports and provided Wagner with ammunition and mobilized personnel as reinforcements in early April 2023.[17]В Prigozhin and Kremlin-affiliated milbloggers amplified claims that Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry PeskovвЂ™s son Nikolai Peskov is reportedly serving with Wagner in UkraineвЂ”likely an information operation to publicly mend the relationship and possibly elevate PrigozhinвЂ™s loyalty to the Kremlin.[18]В Prigozhin had previously been able to impact PutinвЂ™s decision-making by engineering the appointment of Wagner-affiliated commanders and the dismissal of inept military officials and breaking through PutinвЂ™s close circle with his critiques of the progress of the war.[19]В A Russian political expert observed that different Kremlin officials have historically voiced their plans and projects publicly to convince Putin to implement changes, and it is likely that Prigozhin follows the same model of influence.[20]В The Russian military command and select Kremlin officials who are advocating for Putin to freeze the war may have reapproached Prigozhin to influence Putin one more time.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">PutinвЂ™s continued insistence on Russian offensive operations in eastern Ukraine suggests that the group that wants to freeze the war along the current front lines has not fully persuaded Putin.В </strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian forces are continuing attritional offensives to capture Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Marinka in Donetsk Oblast as well as limited offensive operations in Luhansk and western Donetsk Oblast, despite increasing Russian fears about the threat of a potential imminent Ukrainian counteroffensive.[21]В The Russian winter offensive failed to achieve the KremlinвЂ™s ambitious goals of seizing the Donetsk and Luhansk oblast administrative borders by March 31, but it appears that Russian forces have not subsequently deemphasized their operational focus on tactical gains, no matter how marginal and costly those gains are.[22]В Russian forces suffered significant manpower and equipment losses during the winter offensive campaign that are currently constraining their abilities to maintain offensive operations along more than one axis and that will likely limit the Russian militaryвЂ™s ability to respond to possible Ukrainian counteroffensive operations.[23]В Russian forces have not responded to these constraints by prioritizing one axis or by conducting an operational pause along any axis that would allow Russian forces to replenish and reconstitute for a decisive defensive effort. Russia forces are continuing to deploy contract servicemen and remaining combat-effective units to support offensive operations in eastern Ukraine instead of conserving this critical pool of combat power to respond to a Ukrainian counter-offensive.[24]В Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Marinka offer no significant operational benefits to Russian forces, and any marginal tactical gains along any axis are unlikely to improve the Russian militaryвЂ™s ability to defend against a Ukrainian counteroffensive.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Putin may be hesitant to commit to a ceasefire due to the influence of select unknown pro-war figures or out of concern for the implications for his regimeвЂ™s stability.</strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В The insistence on tactical gains suggests that the pro-war camp advocating for maintaining offensives at any cost is likely still influencing PutinвЂ™s decision-making for the war. A possible shift to preparing for defensive operations ahead of a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive would likely indicate that Putin had finally rejected the pro-war campвЂ™s views in favor of the more pragmatic groupвЂ™s. The possible success of the upcoming Ukrainian counteroffensive could determine the outcome of this struggle for influence over PutinвЂ™s decisions.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian occupation authorities are continuing to oppress Roman Catholics in occupied Ukraine, likely in an effort to suppress Ukrainian religious institutions beyond MoscowвЂ™s control</strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">. Head of the Ukrainian Berdyansk City Military Administration Viktoria Halitsina reported on April 22 that Russian forces seized the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in occupied Berdyansk.[25]В Halitsina stated that Russian propagandists accused the clergy of hiding weapons and collaborating with Ukrainian forces because of their previous service as chaplains for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 2015. ISW has also reported on two other instances of Russian occupation authorities persecuting Roman Catholics in occupied Ukraine.[26]В ISW has previously reported on Russian authoritiesвЂ™ weaponization of religion in occupied territories as part of an ongoing cultural genocide.[27]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian authorities continue to arrest personnel associated with the Russian defense industrial base (DIB) likely to justify crackdowns and further conceal DIB activities.</strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) announced on April 22 that it arrested the deputy head of the testing laboratory at the Promtekhnologiya weapons plant in Moscow on suspicion of treason.[28]В The FSB did not provide additional details about the alleged treasonous act. The Promtekhnologiya plant participates in the development and modernization of high-tech weapons. The Promtekhnologiya plant claimed that it had not employed the arrested employee since March 2021.[29]В ISW has reported on other recent arrests that are part of an ongoing crackdown using the pretext of threats to RussiaвЂ™s DIB.[30]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">A Russian fighter-bomber accidentally bombed Belgorod on April 21 with two FAB-500 bombs, one of which likely malfunctioned.</strong><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В Russian authorities announced on April 22 the presence of a second, undetonated bomb that landed in Belgorod.[31]В Belgorod authorities evacuated 3,000 civilians from the city while sappers extracted and later detonated the bomb.[32]В Russian authorities have so far provided no further explanation as to the cause of the accidental bombing. The Russian fighter bomber either intended to drop the bombs on a different target and one bomb failed to detonate, or the fighter bomber did not arm the bombs to drop them, and one bomb improperly detonated.</span><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian forces conducted limited ground attacks along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line on April 22. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces repelled Russian ground attacks near Lyman Pershyi (12km northeast of Kupyansk) and Bilohorivka (12km south of Kreminna).[33]В Russian milbloggers claimed that elements of the Russian 98th Guards Airborne (VDV) Division advanced in the forest area near Kreminna.[34]В Milbloggers claimed that Russian forces conducted ground attacks towards Terny (16km west of Kreminna) and Nevske (19km northwest of Kreminna), and near Kuzymivka (13km northwest of Svatove) and Bilohorivka.[35]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces conducted ground attacks in the Siversk area on April 22. The milblogger claimed that Russian forces conducted ground attacks near Vasyukivka (14km southwest of Siversk), Rozdolivka (12km south of Siversk), Vesele (12km southeast of Siversk), and Spirne (11km southeast of Siversk).[36]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian forces conducted limited counterattacks near Kreminna.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian forces continued to advance around Bakhmut on April 22, although Russian forces have not completed a turning movement around the city. Geolocated footage published on April 21 indicates that Russian forces have advanced up to a section of the O0506 highway northwest of Khromove (immediately west of Bakhmut).[39]В Russian milbloggers claimed that Wagner Group fighters are conducting assaults along the road in the area but reiterated that Russian forces have not encircled Bakhmut as of April 22.[40]В Russian and social media sources claimed that Ukrainian forces have not been using the O0506 highway for some time because Russian forces have been heavily interdicting the road.[41]В Russian and social media sources claimed that Ukrainian forces rely on roads that pass through Ivanivske and on numerous field roads in the area to supply the Ukrainian grouping in Bakhmut.[42]В One Russian milblogger claimed that heavy rains washed out Ukrainian controlled dirt roads into Bakhmut making withdrawals from the city impossible.[43]В Another Russian milblogger continued to claim that heavy rains are preventing wheeled vehicles from using field roads but asserted that Ukrainian forces are able to use tracked vehicles along these roads into Bakhmut.[44]В The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Wagner assault detachments captured three blocks in western Bakhmut.[45]В Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces advanced in southern and central Bakhmut as well as closer to the Olympic reserve school in western Bakhmut, although ISW has not yet observed visual confirmation of further Russian advances within the city.[46]В The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near Hryhorivka (9km northwest of Bakhmut), Bohdanivka (6km northwest of Bakhmut), Khromove, and Ivanivske (6km west of Bakhmut).[47]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian forces continued to conduct offensive operations along the Avdiivka-Donetsk front on April 22. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces conducted unsuccessful offensive operations near Novokalynove (13km north of Avdiivka) and within 27km southwest of Avdiivka near Pervomaiske, Nevelske, and Marinka.[48]В Russian milbloggers claimed that the main battles in the Avdiivka area are occurring west and north of Krasnohorivka (8km north of Avdiivka) and that elements of the Donetsk PeopleвЂ™s Republic (DNR) 132</span><sup>nd</sup><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В Separate Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade conducted a positional attack on Ukrainian positions east of Novokalynove.[49]В A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces thwarted Ukrainian attempts to regain lost positions west of Novobakhmutivka (13km northeast of Avdiivka) near the H-20 highway between Donetsk City and Kostyantynivka.[50]В Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces conducted assaults northwest of Vodyane (8km southwest of Avdiivka) and near Paraskoviivka (36km southwest of Avdiivka).[51]В A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are increasing pressure on Marinka and have recently reinforced the area.[52]В Spokesperson for the Ukrainian Defense Forces in the Tavriisk operational direction Colonel Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi stated on April 22 that Russian forces have deployed poorly trained assault detachments to the Marinka area with orders not to retrieve wounded personnel from the battlefield or to keep track of the number of dead.[53]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian forces conducted a limited ground attack in western Donetsk Oblast on April 22.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian authorities have made headway in their attempts to compel international recognition of Russian ownership over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi stated on April 21 that maintenance at the ZNPP has suffered under occupation and noted that Rosenergoatom, the Russian state nuclear company that occupies the ZNPP, may undertake measures to perform maintenance tasks.[57]В Grossi also stated that Ukraine has not repaired a ZNPP power line in Ukraine-held territory damaged in early March, while Russia is working to restore three powerlines connecting the ZNPP to Russian-held territory. The IAEAвЂ™s messaging resists formally acknowledging Russian ownership over the ZNPP while carving out space to acknowledge without complaint that Russian authorities are performing essential work for the ZNPP, work that Ukrainian authorities are unable to perform while Russia continues to occupy the plant. Grossi also noted damage to windows in the turbine hall of Reactor No. 4 at the ZNPP that is inconsistent with prior reports of landmine explosions.[58]В Russian authorities used GrossiвЂ™s statements about the damage to claim on April 22 that a Ukrainian UAV attack damaged the turbine hall, implying that Russia is the only safe operator of the ZNPP.[59]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Ukrainian forces and likely partisans continue to target Russian logistics nodes in rear areas in southern Ukraine. Crimean occupation head Sergey Aksyonov claimed that Russian air defenses shot down an unspecified weapon targeting the Kerch Strait Bridge, causing no damage to the bridge or any casualties.[60]В Russian sources made conflicting claims whether the weapon was a Ukrainian UAV or a missile from a Hrim-2 short-range ballistic missile system, indicating that Russian authorities may not know or will not disclose the weapon type.[61]В Russian occupation authorities also accused Ukrainian partisans of bombing a railway depot in occupied Melitopol, Zaporizhia Oblast.[62]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian forces continued routine fire west of Hulyaipole and in Kherson Oblast on April 22.

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Continued Russian efforts to block evacuations of wounded soldiersвЂ”likely in a blanket effort to prevent soldiers from leaving the combat zoneвЂ”have reportedly contributed to the deaths of some Russian soldiers. The Ukrainian General Staff reported on April 22 that soldiers on the Russian border turned back a 14-truck medical evacuation convoy from Luhansk Oblast and that some soldiers died in transit (presumably to overflowing Luhansk Oblast hospitals) due to a lack of proper medical care.[65]В ISW has previously observed Russian efforts to redeploy wounded soldiers and prevent their evacuation.[66]В Russian command likely intends to prevent the significant number of demoralized soldiers from faking injury to escape combat and is not very concerned about soldiersвЂ™ fitness for combat, as many soldiers are used in human-wave style attacks. This reported incident at the Russian border is further notable because it suggests that there remains a clear set of checkpoints blocking traffic and dividing Russia from its вЂњannexedвЂќ territories, undermining Russian claims that it has integrated occupied Ukrainian territories.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Several Russian and Ukrainian sources reported that Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin critiqued on April 21 the recent creation of what he presented as a slew of Russian private military companies (PMCs), including GazpromвЂ™s вЂњPotokвЂќ PMC. Prigozhin claimed there now exists вЂњa couple of them for each creature,вЂќ referring to several major Russian groups each launching its own PMC.[67]В Russian milblogger Igor Girkin responded on April 22 that non-Wagner PMCs are not a new phenomenon. Girkin quipped that the other PMCs have much lower combat capabilities than the Wagner Group did before the Wagner Group began its assault on Bakhmut but that alternative PMC commanders are PrigozhinвЂ™s equals in all other aspects.[68]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian State Duma Parliamentarian Stanislav Naumov acknowledged on April 22 that Russian forces are struggling to supply soldiers with necessary components for equipment. Naumov stated that he would create a private military company (PMC) or an online вЂњhypermarketвЂќ for military equipment to support Russian force provisioning if there were no restrictions on such activity.[69]В Provisioning remains a major issue for the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD), and soldiers often purchase elements of their own gear and medical supplies.[70]В Milbloggers and volunteer groups frequently collect items such as basic equipment, vehicles, and component parts for Russian soldiers, indirectly demonstrating many shortcomings in official military logistics and supply efforts.[71]</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian officials are likely struggling to fund benefits and support programs for Russian soldiers despite ongoing discussions about new ways to increase the appeal of military service. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's Main Military Intelligence Directorate (GUR) published on April 21 an intercepted call from a Russian soldier in which the soldier claimed that the Russian command retroactively transfers soldiers to other units or files them as missing to avoid making cash payments for soldier injuries or deaths.[72]В Russian opposition news sourceВ </span><em style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Mobilization NewsВ </em><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">reported on April 22 that Russian recruiters removed mention of issuing microcredits from advertising booklets in Yeysk, Krasnodar Krai.[73]В A prominent Russian news aggregator claimed on April 21 that Russian Presidential Administration Deputy Sergey Kiriyenko met with the Defenders of the Fatherland Supervisory Board to discuss organizing social support and assistance for veterans and their families, however. The news aggregator claimed that the meeting emphasized that the fighters are the вЂњnew eliteвЂќ of Russia.[74]В This is likely a continuation of efforts to increase the appeal of military service and cater to the growing veteran electorate.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian authorities continue to illegally and indefinitely detain soldiers who refuse to fight in Ukraine. Russian opposition news sourcesВ </span><em style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">ASTRAВ </em><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">andВ </span><em style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Mobilization NewsВ </em><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">reported on April 22 that authorities in Pakino, Vladimir Oblast are detaining 40 mobilized and contract soldiers in a military unit without a court order or initiated case.[75]</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian occupation officials are continuing to expand patronage networks in occupied territories. Luhansk PeopleвЂ™s Republic (LNR) Head Leonid Pasechnik announced that United Russia launched the вЂњOur ControlвЂќ project that will allow local occupation heads, representatives of public organizations, members of the LNR council, and residents to inspect infrastructure restored under patronage arrangements with Russian federal subjects.[76]В Pasechnik stated that occupation officials have already carried out the first inspection in Markivskyi Raion east of Starobilsk with Voronezh Oblast specialists. The Kremlin is likely extending Russian-style corruption systems to occupied territories in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">Russian occupation officials are continuing to announce plans for infrastructure projects in occupied Ukraine. Chairman of the Kherson Oblast Occupation Government Andrey Alekseyenko claimed that Russia will start operating electric trains in May from Henichesk in southeastern Kherson Oblast to Dzhankoi in Crimea.[77]В Occupation officials are reportedly planning to open additional train routes from Henichesk to Simferopol, and a railway line between Vadym station in Preobrazhenka, Kalanchak, Myrne, Armyansk, and Simferopol. Both claimed infrastructure projects are located along Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) and are likely part of ongoing Russian efforts to reinstate railway connections in southern UkraineвЂ”possibly to improve Russian logistics networks.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">The Kremlin is reportedly allocating 410.7 billion rubles to sustain Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine.[78]В Russian state-affiliated outletВ </span><em style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">RBK</em><span style=""font-size: 13.008px;"">В reported that the Donetsk PeopleвЂ™s Republic (DNR) will receive the largest subsidies of all occupied territoriesвЂ”more than 171 billion rubles.[79]В Russian subsidies to DNR are larger than previous transfers to annexed Crimea in 2014.</span></p>
